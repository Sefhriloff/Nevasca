# Nevasca
Nevasca is an HTML5 remake of the Lumisota client. This client is designed to work alongside the original client.

⚠️ **Please Note:** The project is currently playable, but there are some features that are still in progress. Here are the points that are missing:

- Registration Option: The current version of the project does not include a registration option. This is due to the original setup where the game and main page were on separate servers.
- Additional Features: Some buttons, animations, and chat functionality are still under development and will be added in future updates.

## How to set up?

1. **Download the Lumisota Server:** Begin by downloading the Lumisota server made by Ascii from this [link](https://puomi.tunk.org/snowstroem/files/).

2. **Set Up websockify:** To connect your client to the Lumisota server, you'll need to use websockify. Start by following the instructions on the [websockify GitHub page](https://github.com/novnc/websockify).
